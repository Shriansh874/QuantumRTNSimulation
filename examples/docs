# Explanation of Quantum RTN Simulation

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the `QuantumRTNSimulation` class, detailing its functionality, methods, and usage.

## Initialization
The `QuantumRTNSimulation` class is initialized with the following parameters:

- tau_high: Average duration spent in the high state.
- tau_low: Average duration spent in the low state.
- total_time: Total duration of the simulation.
- dt: Time step for each iteration of the simulation.
- noise_level_gaussian: Standard deviation of the added Gaussian noise.
- noise_level_flicker: Magnitude of the 1/f (flicker) noise.
- hamiltonian: Hamiltonian matrix used for quantum time evolution.
- states: Number of states in the RTN signal (default is 2).

## Methods
generate_rtn_signal()
This method generates the Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) signal by alternating between high and low states based on exponential distributions of `tau_high` and `tau_low`.

### add_noise()
Adds noise to the generated RTN signal:
- Gaussian Noise: Added using a normal distribution with standard deviation `noise_level_gaussian`.
- 1/f Noise: Added using a cumulative sum of normally distributed random values scaled by `noise_level_flicker`.

### quantum_time_evolution()
Simulates the quantum time evolution of the system using the provided Hamiltonian matrix. The method computes the time evolution operator and applies it to the state vector over time.

### plot_signals()
Plots the noisy RTN signal and the quantum state probability over time, providing a visual representation of the simulation results.

### plot_psd()
Plots the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the noisy RTN signal, showing the signal's power distribution across different frequencies.

### plot_fft()
Plots the Fourier Transform (FFT) of the noisy RTN signal, illustrating the signal's frequency components.

### plot_autocorrelation()
Plots the autocorrelation of the noisy RTN signal, which indicates how the signal correlates with itself over different time lags.

### plot_partial_autocorrelation()
Plots the partial autocorrelation of the noisy RTN signal, showing the direct correlation between the signal and its lagged values.

### plot_histogram()
Plots a histogram of the noisy RTN signal, providing a visual representation of the signal's value distribution. A normal distribution fit is also included.

### locate_charge_traps()
Identifies charge traps in the RTN signal by detecting transitions between states. The method can also cluster these charge traps for further analysis.

### plot_traps()
Plots the identified charge traps on the noisy RTN signal, highlighting the locations and clusters of these traps.

### statistical_analysis()
Performs a statistical analysis on the noisy RTN signal, calculating:
- Mean: Average value of the signal.
- Variance: Measure of signal variability.
- Skewness: Measure of signal asymmetry.
- Kurtosis: Measure of signal peakiness.
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test: Compares the signal distribution to a normal distribution, providing D and p-values.
